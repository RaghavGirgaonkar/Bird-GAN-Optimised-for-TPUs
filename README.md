# Bird-GAN-Optimised-for-TPUs
A Generative Adversarial Network for creating Birds: optimised to run on  Google's Tensor Processing Units

The network was trained on the [Bird Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species) which has over 58000 images of birds across 400 different species. 

The architecture of the GAN was inspired by [this Face-GAN](https://github.com/jeffheaton/present/blob/master/youtube/gan/gans_scratch.ipynb)
